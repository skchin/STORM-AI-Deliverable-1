	abstract = {The fundamental challenge facing security professionals is preventing losses, be they operational, financial or mission losses. As a result, one could argue that security professionals share this challenge with safety professionals. Despite their shared challenge, there is little evidence that recent advances that enable one community to better prevent losses have been shared with the other for possible implementation. Limitations in current safety approaches have led researchers and practitioners to develop new models and techniques. These techniques could potentially benefit the field of security. This paper describes a new systems thinking approach to safety that may be suitable for meeting the challenge of securing complex systems against cyber disruptions. Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis for Security (STPA-Sec) augments traditional security approaches by introducing a top-down analysis process designed to help a multidisciplinary team consisting of security, operations, and domain experts identify and constrain the system from entering vulnerable states that lead to losses. This new framework shifts the focus of the security analysis away from threats as the proximate cause of losses and focuses instead on the broader system structure that allowed the system to enter a vulnerable system state that the threat exploits to produce the disruption leading to the loss.},

	abstract = {Cyber-physical systems that are employed as part of a decision-making framework require a measure of behavior assurance to characterize their function. Further, such an assurance measure needs to accommodate both safety and security considerations in the design and implementation of such components. A key measure relevant to the emergence of data-driven and learning-enabled components is that of trustworthiness. Trustworthiness of a system is of paramount importance for all safety and security relevant systems, but of particular significance for autonomous systems operating without a human pilot or operator in the control-feedback loop. Further, emerging technologies such as data-driven ML and AI-based approaches that represent quantum jumps in tactical mission capabilities, demand a measure of confidence prior to their integration into existing decision frameworks. While we may be able to characterize an AI system’s capabilities by observing its behavior, we cannot understand its limitations and potential negative capabilities not obvious in the training data, opening up the possibility of unintended behaviors and thus a degree of unpredictability. We present a systems engineering methodology based on mission engineering coupled with system theoretic analysis, which provides a formal representation of system level security properties that can be mapped to lower level subsystem specifications and verified using conventional approaches. We address some of the underlying computing platform requirements necessary to ensure the successful implementation of safe, secure, trustworthy and resilient autonomous operations. This paper focuses on factors that impact trustworthiness, methods to estimate and assess it, design approaches that can integrate and support enhanced trustworthiness, as well as methods to verify and validate trustworthiness-relevant system requirements. Some relevant examples are provided in the context of an autonomous aircraft system and its relevant subsystems.},

	abstract = {Incorporating security into the design of components used in the Internet of Things (IoT) is essential for securing the operations of the IoT and the cyber‐physical infrastructure upon which society depends. To learn and draw inspiration from the past, this chapter looks at the 1970s and 1980s when the challenges of designing and implementing very large‐scale integrated (VLSI) circuits were encountered and overcome. The chapter defines the syntax, semantics, and inference rules for an access‐control logic used to reason about command and control (C2). Cryptographic operations are an integral part of protecting integrity and confidentiality. The chapter also provides algebraic models in higher‐order logic (HOL) theorem of idealized cryptographic operations. The chapter describes the objectives of certified security by design (CSBD), provides a simple motivating application as context, and states the critical requirements that must be satisfied to make CSBD a reality.},

	abstract = {Design for assurance of security, from the hardware level on up, is essential for securing the integrity of the smart cyber-physical infrastructure that is the Internet of Things. If the smart cyber-physical infrastructure fails to do the right things—that is, if it loses integrity because it is insecure and vulnerable—then untold social consequences will occur. For the security and integrity of cyber-physical systems to improve, not only must engineers and computer scientists possess the capability to design-in security from the very beginning, but they must do so in ways that enable people other than the designers to reproduce and check verification results easily and quickly. Designers and certifiers must formally describe and verify operations at high levels, such as the command-and-control (C2) protocols used by commanders and operators, down to the operations of applications and hardware. We call this design and verification capability for security and integrity certified security by design (CSBD). Our experience leads us to conclude that CSBD is feasible and practical for undergraduates. What makes CSBD feasible at the undergraduate level is similar to what made very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuit design feasible in the 1980s: (1) rigorous, simplified, and parameterized design and analytical methods spanning multiple levels of abstraction, and (2) computer-aided design and verification tools to mitigate complexity and problems of scale.},

To mimic realistic human behaviors, attributes of the BDI framework are reverse-engineered from the human-in-the-loop experiments conducted in the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE). The proposed modeling framework is demonstrated for human's evacuation behaviors under a terrorist bomb attack situation. The simulated environment and agents (human model) conforming to the proposed BDI framework are implemented in AnyLogic{\textregistered} agent-based simulation software, where each agent calls external Netica BBN software to perform its perceptual processing function and Soar software to perform its real-time planning and decision-execution functions. The constructed simulation has been used to test impact of several factors (e.g. demographics of people, number of policemen) on evacuation performance (e.g. average evacuation time, percentage of casualties).},

	Abstract = {This article describes the approach to create the multi-agent system (MAS) for simulating transport corridors. There are few new ideas that were used during the developing the system. JASON language used in implementation of this system is a relatively new approach. A commitment based communication was described before in few papers but there is a little about its implementation. The social aspects of agents are emphasizes in this paper. Although the system is not fully implemented, the combination of Prometheus methodology and JASON language seems to be the good choice for developing the multi-agent systems.},
