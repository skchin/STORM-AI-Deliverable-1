@inproceedings{Lee:2008:IHD:1516744.1516904,
	Abstract = {An integrated Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) modeling framework is proposed for human decision making and planning, whose sub-modules are based on Bayesian belief network (BBN), Decision-Field-Theory (DFT), and probabilistic depth first search (PDFS) technique. To mimic realistic human behaviors, attributes of the BDI framework are reverse-engineered from the human-in-the-loop experiments conducted in the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE). The proposed modeling framework is demonstrated for human's evacuation behaviors under a terrorist bomb attack situation. The simulated environment and agents (human model) conforming to the proposed BDI framework are implemented in AnyLogic{\textregistered} agent-based simulation software, where each agent calls external Netica BBN software to perform its perceptual processing function and Soar software to perform its real-time planning and decision-execution functions. The constructed simulation has been used to test impact of several factors (e.g. demographics of people, number of policemen) on evacuation performance (e.g. average evacuation time, percentage of casualties).},

	Abstract = {This article describes the approach to create the multi-agent system (MAS) for simulating transport corridors. There are few new ideas that were used during the developing the system. JASON language used in implementation of this system is a relatively new approach. A commitment based communication was described before in few papers but there is a little about its implementation. The social aspects of agents are emphasizes in this paper. Although the system is not fully implemented, the combination of Prometheus methodology and JASON language seems to be the good choice for developing the multi-agent systems.},
